# hello-world
New to GitHub. Self Taught. Hoping to use Ghidra to optimize files.
I've now began making edits to the readme. Changes like this are called commits and descriptions like this are called commit messages. I shold get used to this standard procedure if I want to become a real SRE technician on GitHub.
